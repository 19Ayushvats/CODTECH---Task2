## Overview of the Project<br>

### Project : House Price Predictive Analytics Using Linear Regression<br>

### Objective : <br>
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on various features such as Age of House, Avg Rooms, Avg Bedrooms, Population, AvgOccup , Latitude, Longitude. This model aims to assist potential buyers, real estate agents, and investors in making informed decisions by providing accurate price predictions.

### Key activities<br>
**Data Collection and Preprocessing:** The dataset is sourced from publicly available real estate databases, which include historical house prices and related features,Handling missing values, outlier detection, and ensuring data consistency.<br>

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using charts and graphs to understand the distribution of house prices and the relationship between features,identifying correlations and patterns within the data to inform model selection and parameter tuning.<br>

**Model Development:** Implementing a linear regression algorithm to predict house prices based on the selected features,splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance,adjusting model parameters to improve accuracy and reduce prediction errors.<br>

**Model Evaluation:**  Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess the model's accuracy, conducting cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.<br>

### Technologies Used<br>
**Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis.<br>

**Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment for running Python code and visualizing results.<br>

**Pandas:** A library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly.<br>

**NumPy:** A library for numerical computations, which provides support for arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.<br>

**Matplotlib:** A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.<br>

**Seaborn:** A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.<br>
